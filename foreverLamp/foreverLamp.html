        <h1>The Forever Lamp</h1>
        <section class="overview" id="overviewDiv">
          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
          A lamp that will last you a lifetime. Through carefully selected materials and replaceable parts, the lamp never goes out of style! Choose from a big selection of different armatures and lamp shades to create your custom lamp. This product design project was part of the course sustainable development.</p>

          <p><b>The challenge</b><br>In today’s society, people consume products at a faster rate than the planet can tolerate. There are multiple underlying causes for this behaviour. On the one end, it’s the consumers who constantly buy the latest interior items. On the other hand, it is the producer who produces bad quality products for a cheap price.</p><br>

        <section class="process" id="processDiv"><h2>Process</h2>
          <p>To start analysing the problem, the team analyzed the lamp's function and disassembled it. Granta EduPack was used to conduct a life cycle assessment to identify the main sustainability issues. The main findings were:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Non-adjustable brightness.</span><br>The light from the lamp was very bright and could not be adjusted</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Hard to disassemble</span><br>Many parts were glued together, making it impossible to repair it with spare parts when broken</i></li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Unsustainable materials</span><br>The use of plastic and silicone for many of the lamps' parts. The lamp was very flexible and there was a big metal chunk in the bottom of the lamp, preventing it to fall over. </i></li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Hard maintenance materials</span><br>The plastic can get yellow and appealing over time. The silicone on the handle attracts dirt and dust and it is hard to clean.</i></li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Long transportation</span><br>The lamp was made overseas, which means long transport to get to Sweden.</i></li>
            </ul>

            In the course, we were presented with different design approaches for sustainable products. Two of them were chosen for our project: Design for attachment and Design for graceful ageing. The reason that the cheap lamp was probably not thrown away was that it was broken, but because people simply got tired of it or because it was ageing poorly.

        <section class="result" id="resultDiv"><h2>Result</h2>
          <img src="pictures/styles.png">
          <p> Forever Lamp has a minimalistic design with few components that easily can be replaced. No longer a single component that determines the life span of the lamp. It is timeless and can be placed in most rooms around your home. Since personal taste might change as time passes, the lamp has different armature and shades to go with it.  
          </p>
          <img src="pictures/parts.png">
          <p>This is how we solved the problems:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Non-adjustable brightness</span><br>The light has a dimmer that controls the light</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Hard to disassemble</span><br>All the parts are detachable.</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Unsustainable materials</span><br>The lamp neck and base are made out of pine trees and the lamp shade is made out of stainless steel.</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Hard maintenance materials</span><br>All the materials age beautifully and are easy to care for. The cord is covered in fabric to avoid plastic that can crack or change colour over time.</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Long transportation</span><br>Pine was chosen as the main material since it is sourced in Sweden.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
          It is easy to get caught up in designing an aesthetically beautiful and functional product. This course project gave me a new approach to the design process that I previously had not used. My main takeaway from this project is that do your research before starting the ideation process, to pinpoint the most unsustainable parts of the project. it might not always be visible, such as long transportation or other emissions during manufacturing.
