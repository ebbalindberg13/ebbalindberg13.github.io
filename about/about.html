          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p> Hi! My name is Ebba and I am currently based in Gothenburg where I doing my final year of my masterâ€™s degree in Interaction Design & Technologies. In my spare time I like to crochet, mostly freehanded clothes and home decor items, or unwind with a cup of tea to some reality show.</p>

          <p>Ever since growing up, I have liked being creative and always trying new things. I remember that I had a teacher in kindergarten that let us try a multitude of handicrafts such as candle making, hand sewing, combing wool and sculpting in clay. And I loved it! 
          </p>

          <p> As an interaction designer, I'm hoping to create awesome user experiences by combining my analytical and creative skills. One of my favorite things is having the opportunity to have genuine interactions with the users and hear a glimpse of their stories. Feeling that you can make their life easier makes all the difference.</p>
