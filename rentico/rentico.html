          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
          Rentico is an app which helps families with kids  to advertise and rent stuff from each other. Families with children need to buy an awful lot of stuff such as, clothes, toys, pets, books etc. A smarter and more sustainable solution could be if you could simply rent what you need for a period of time and also let others rent things you have but donâ€™t really need currently.</p>

          <p><b>Project brief</b><br>This was an home exam assignment, carried out in the span of 2 days. The task was to create an user interface for an app that allowed families to rent stuff from each other. No user tests were conducted due to limited time.</p><br>

            I worked with orange as my primary color, gving a sense of warmth. For my secondary color, I chose a contrasting blue, which I used for many of my interactive elements.

          It is easy to get caught up in designing an aesthetically beautiful and functional product. This course project gave me a new approach to the design process that I previously had not used. My main takeaway from this project is that do your research before starting the ideation process, to pinpoint the most unsustainable parts of the project. it might not always be visible, such as long transportation or other emissions during manufacturing.
