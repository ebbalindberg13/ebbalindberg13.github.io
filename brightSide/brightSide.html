          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
        The Bright Side is a two-player game where the opponents stand on either side of the wall. Under time pressure, the players try to claim as many buttons as they can by tapping them. Whoever has the most buttons claimed in the end, wins!</p><br>

          <p><b>Project brief</b><br>
          Generation Pep is a non-profit organization with a vision that each child and teenanger should have the ability to live an active and healthy life. However, only two out of ten kids meet the daily recommendation of physical activity. Generation Pep therefore collaborated with Chalmers in a project where the goal was to engage kids in bodily movement.</p><br>

          <p>Through an iterative design process, The Bright Side was born. The project started off with brainstorming and benchmark to see what was already available. We quickly decided on making a game and found inspiration in a one-player wall with buttons that could be found at Universeum. To make it more fun, we wanted to develop a multiplayer game as the competitive aspect will create more body movement. We made lo-fi prototypes where we tested sizing of the wall, and number of buttons. A 1:10 sktechmodel was made for construction purposes.</p>
          <img src="pictures/userTest.png">
          <p> When a basic layout and idea of gameplay was done, we performed user tests with 4 participants. We used different colored sticky notes to represent the buttons and wizard of oz to control them. Things we evaluated was the duration of gameplay, the layout and if the game was fun and got the heart beat up. The participants in the study appreciated the game and said that it was fun even though some of them uttered that it might be hard to estimate the experience of the final product based on the low-fi prototype. Some of them stated that they would prefer a bigger wall with a larger amount of buttons since they could be stationed in the middle of the wall and reach all buttons without moving their feet.</p>

We generated ideas regarding shape and function. The primary
focus was to explore as many ideas as possible. Physical representations of the concepts were used evaluated against the current air purifyer. The ideation phase was an iterative
process where both the company and users were included throughout the project.

         We eliminated all the loose components when changing filter. To communicate how to change filter, the air purifier has two parts in different and distinct materials. Maxivent opens easily with a hinge for filter exchange and give the users a front view with easy access to the fiters. This elimantes any unergonomical positions. To give it a modern look, we rounded the corners and made concious choices as where and how we designed the air grilles with incorporated logos.

         Prior to this project, I had only been working on school projects without stakeholders. The company we worked for wanted to release this to the market. Thus, we had to think about not only the design and function, but also how to construct and manufacter the new air purifyer. This was a new realm to me, and we had to adapt our design according to certain constraints. I also learned how to work together with a company and their stakeholders since we were in close contact with them throughout the whole design process.
