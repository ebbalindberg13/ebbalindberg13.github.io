        <h1>Redesign of Maxivent Air Purifyer</h1>
        <section class="overview" id="overviewDiv">
          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
          I helped redesign Maxivent air purifyer by ÅSS Processventilation for my bachelor thesis. Since the 90s, the company has distributed Maxivent which is a product made for purifying the air indoors. It's mounted in the ceiling and cleans the air with 3 filters. The product hasn't undergone any major changes since its release. The purpose of the bachelor thesis was to simplify the exchange of filters, create a new control system and equip the air purifier with a classic and discreet look.</p><br>

        <section class="problem"><h2>Prestudy</h2>
          <img src="pictures/problem.png">
          <p>We started off with a benchmark and researching the existing air purifier to get an understanding of the product and market that was new to us. We then moved on to interviews and a survey study with current users. The findings were analyzed with the KJ technique and these problems were identified:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Non-intuitive filter exchange</span><br>The air purifier has an unconventional way of changing the filter. The lack of feedback when done correctly also made it hard for the users to change filters.</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Loose components</span><br>Loose components were a problem when changing filters, especially since the air purifyer usually is attached to the ceiling and a ladder is needed to reach it. Meaning that there is nowhere to put all the loose components without having to climb down the ladder and put them on a table.</li>
               <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Unergonomic positions</span><br>When changing the filter the users had to be in strange positions to be able to see and reach all of the components.</li>
               <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Unpleasing design</span><br>When the users were asked to describe the look of the air purifier, the recurring words were box-like, heavy and ugly.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Ideation and conceptualization</b><br>
            <img src="pictures/moodboard.png">
We generated ideas regarding shape and function. The primary
focus was to explore as many ideas as possible. A morphological matrix was used together with all of our subsolutions. Finally, 3 concepts were put together of which we made sketch models to evaluate the spatial feeling. With help of a decision matrix, solution 1 was chosen.

          </p>
          <b>User tests</b><br>

 We made two types of user evaluations. One test regarding the filter exchange, where we put the sketch models up next to the real air purifier and the novice users performed filter exchange on both of them. The second test concerned the aesthetic. People were presented with materials, colors and shapes that they evaluated on a semantic word scale.

        <section class="Result"><h2>Result</h2>
          <img src="pictures/result.png">
          <p>
         We eliminated all the loose components when changing filters. To communicate how to change them, the air purifier has two parts in different and distinct materials. Maxivent opens easily with a hinge for filter exchange and gives the users a front view with easy access to the filters. This eliminates any unergonomic positions. To give it a modern look, we rounded the corners and made conscious choices as to where and how we designed the air grilles with incorporated logos.

        <section class="Reflection"><h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
         Prior to this project, I had only been working on school projects without stakeholders. The company we worked for wanted to release this to the market. Thus, we had to think about not only the design and function but also how to construct and manufacture the new air purifier. This was a new realm to me, and we had to adapt our design according to certain constraints. I also learned how important it is to have close communication with the company to avoid any misunderstandings.
