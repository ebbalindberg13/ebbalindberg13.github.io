        <h1>Redesign of Maxivent airpurifyer</h1>
        <section class="overview" id="overviewDiv">
          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
          I helped redesign Maxivent Airpurifyer by ÅSS Processventilation for my bachelor thesis. Since the 90’s, the company has distributed Maxivent which is a product made for purifying air indoors. The product has not undergone any major changes since its release. The purpose of the bachelor thesis was to simplify the exchange of filters, create a new control system and equip the air purifier with a classic and discreet look.</p><br>

        <section class="problem"><h2>Prestudy</h2>
          <img src="pictures/problem.png">
          <p>We started off with benchmarking and researching the existing air purifyer. We then moved on to interviews, observations and surveys when the users changed filters, these problems were identified.
            <ul>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Non-intuitive filter exchange</span><br>The airpurifier has an unconventional way of changing filter. The lack of feedback when done correctly also made it hard to for the users to change filter.</li>
              <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Loose components</span><br>Loose components was a problem when changing filter, especially since the airpurifyer usually is attached to the ceiling and a ladder is needed to reach it. Meaning that there is nowhere to put all the loose components without having to climb down from the ladder and put them on a table.</li>
               <li><span class="fontStyleBullet">Unergonomic positions</span><br>When changing filter the users had to be in strange position to be able to see and reach all of the components.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="ideation and conceptualization"><h2>Designing: Ideation and conceptualization</h2>
          <img src="pictures/designing.png">
          <p>
We generated ideas regarding shape and function. The primary
focus was to explore as many ideas as possible. Physical representations of the concepts were used evaluated against the current air purifyer. The ideation phase was an iterative
process where both the company and users were included throughout the project.

        <section class="Result"><h2>Result</h2>
          <img src="pictures/result.png">
          <p>
         We eliminated all the loose components when changing filter. To communicate how to change filter, the air purifier has two parts in different and distinct materials. Maxivent opens easily with a hinge for filter exchange and give the users a front view with easy access to the fiters. This elimantes any unergonomical positions. To give it a modern look, we rounded the corners and made concious choices as where and how we designed the air grilles with incorporated logos.

        <section class="Reflection"><h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
         Prior to this project, I had only been working on school projects without stakeholders. The company we worked for wanted to release this to the market. Thus, we had to think about not only the design and function, but also how to construct and manufacter the new air purifyer. This was a new realm to me, and we had to adapt our design according to certain constraints. I also learned how to work together with a company and their stakeholders since we were in close contact with them throughout the whole design process.
