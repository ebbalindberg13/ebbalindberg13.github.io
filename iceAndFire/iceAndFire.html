          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
        Giving the poem “Fire and Ice” by Robert Frost another dimension. The poem is interactive with sound and original artwork for an immersive experience. This was an individual project in a course in computational media literacy that I took in Singapore. As a final project, many of my peers chose to develop games. But I wanted to take the opportunity to make something meaningful for me and something I had never done before.</p><br>

          <b>Research</b><br>
           Since I had limited experience with what an interactive poem was I had to do my research beforehand. Things I looked at were what kind of artworks could be used, their storytelling and what types of interactions that were possible to use. After establishing a good understanding of interactive poems, I chose a poem for myself to use. I started by analyzing the poem and researching it to get an understanding of all the nuances in it. Even though it is a short poem of a few rows, it still has a lot of different meanings to different people. I then started brainstorming about what interactions, sounds and artwork I could incorporate into the poem to add another layer to its meaning.

  <b>Implementation</b><br></p>
<img src="pictures/sketches.png"><br>I created sketches on paper which I edited in photoshop. Once done with all the sketches I started to code, in JavaScript to create all of the interactions, together with some HTML and CSS for basic structure and styling. The library Raphael was used for the geometric shapes.</p>

          <p>
         To work on a project where the focus became creative freedom was new and exciting for me. I learned that the typical design process could be applied in other ways than just designing products or websites. It really showed me that I could use all the skills I have collected and put them to use in a new, different context than I'm used to. I big challenge that I faced was the fact that JavaScript was completely new to me, hence I had to spend a lot of time coding and structuring the content. It took longer than I anticipated and I only had 3 weeks to complete the project while having 4 other courses. This meant that I had to downscale the number of interactive elements on each page.
