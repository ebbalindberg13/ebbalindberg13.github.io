          <p><b>Overview</b><br>
        Giving the poem “Fire and Ice” by Robert Frost another dimension. The poem is interactive with sound and original artwork for an immersive experience. This was an individual project in a cource in computational media literacy that I took in Singapore. As a final project, many of my peers chose to develop games. But I wanted to take the oppertunity to make something meaningful for me and something I had never done before.</p><br>

          <b>Research</b><br>
           Since I had limited experience of what an interactive poem was I had to do my research beforehand. Things I looked at what kind of artworks that could be used, their storytelling and what types of interactions that was possible to use. After having establishing a good understanding of interactive poems, I chose a poem for myself to use. I started with analyzing the poem and researching about it to get an understanding of all the nuances in it. Even though it is a short poem of a few rows, it still has a lot of different meaning to different people. I then started brainstorming about what interactions, sounds and artwork that I could incorporate into the poem to add to the meaning of it.

  <b>Implementation</b><br></p>
<img src="pictures/sketches.png"><br>I created sketches on paper which I edited is Photoshop. Once done with all the sketches I started to code, in used JavaScript to create all of the interactions, together with some HTML and CSS for basic structure and styling. The library Raphael was used for the geometric shapes.</p>

         To work on a project where the focus became the creative freedom was new and exciting for me. I learned that the typical design process could be applied in other ways than just designing producst or websites. It really showed me that I could use all the skills I have collected and put them to use in a new, different context than I'm used to. I big challenge that I faced was the fact that JavaScript was completely new to me, hence I had to spend a lot on time coding the iteractions. It took longer than I anticipated and I only had 3 weeks to complete the project while having 4 other courses. This meant that I had to downscale the amount of interactive elements on each page.
